# Deprecation Notice
eris-sharder is deprecated. Version 2 of eris-sharder is full rewrite and has been renamed [discord-sharder](https://github.com/Discord-Sharders/core).

# About

discord-sharder is a pluggable control plane for splitting up shards into groups of "clusters"

# Reason

I originally created [eris-sharder](https://github.com/Discord-Sharders/eris-sharder) over a year ago. However, I was pushed by myself, and others, to completely rewrite eris-sharder in order to fix many present issues. Thus, discord-sharder was born.

# Installation
To download discord-sharder, run `npm install @discord-sharder/core --save`
